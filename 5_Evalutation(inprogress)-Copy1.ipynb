    "At this moment, the organization has no plans to procure external databases or invest in dispatching teams to each site as its engineers, analysts, and managers are busy managing the data they currently have. At some point, however, they might want to consider an extended deployment of data mining results, in which case purchasing additional IT infrastructure to capture sensor data not centrally registered may be quite useful. It may also be helpful to have demographic information to see how the maintainers across regions vary in skill set and maintenance practices."
